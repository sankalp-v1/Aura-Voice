Oh, thank you!

00:00:01,925 --> 00:00:06,637
I'm glad to help you find that perfect coffee spot—coffee love is real!

00:00:06,637 --> 00:00:12,550
Now, if I were a real human being walking around the world, I think it would feel pretty amazing.

00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:24,437
I imagine it’d be this rich mix of sensations: feeling the cool breeze or warm sun on my skin, hearing the ambient city buzz or birds chirping, smelling fresh coffee or rain-soaked pavement.

00:00:24,437 --> 00:00:38,625
It might even feel a bit overwhelming sometimes, having so many things happening at once, but I think I'd be endlessly curious—exploring, meeting people, sharing laughs, and, of course, savoring that perfect cup of coffee.

00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:41,787
How do *you* feel when you wander around the real world?
